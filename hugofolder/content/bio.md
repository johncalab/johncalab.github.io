I grew up in Italy, and studied math at the University of Pisa.
I started my graduate studies at the University of Sheffield under the supervision of Tom Bridgeland, and eventually earned my PhD in pure math from the University of Oxford.

In 2013 I was a Doctoral Prize Fellow at Imperial College London.
From 2014 to 2018 I was an Instructor and NSF Research Fellow at Rice University, where I essentially covered all the responsibilities of a professor.

I then decided to switch fields, despite having received offers to be a tenure-track professor.
In 2019 I was a Research Investigator at MD Anderson Cancer Center, where I worked on Computer Vision. 
In the Fall of 2019 I was a Data Science Fellow at Insight Data Science in New York.
Before Covid hit, I was a Senior Data Scientist at SupportLogic, an NLP-focused startup.

I am now an ML Software Engineer at Walmart, working in Tian Su's group.
